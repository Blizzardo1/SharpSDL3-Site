  summary: >-
    This is a callback that signifies that a channel has finished all its loops

    and has completed playback.
  remarks: >-
    This gets called if the buffer plays out normally, or if you call

    Mix_HaltChannel(), implicitly stop a channel via Mix_AllocateChannels(), or

    unregister a callback while it's still playing.
